# Notes, by Nota
## Nota
Nota, is a simple script to manage notes. It manages all my class notes which are markdown
files and compiles them to PDF versions. This is so people can see my notes and I can share 
them easier. Not only that but the PDF version makes for easier reading, while the markdown
versions are easy to edit and easy to search for items. Hope you enjoy!
