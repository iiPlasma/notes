# Running Times
## Algorithm Analysis
- Space Efficiency: Somewhat Important
- Time Efficiency: **SUPER IMPORTANT!**

## Running Time 
`Running Time = T(n)`
- N is usually the size of the input:
    - Number of items to sort
    - Number of items to search
    - Size of objects

- Cases:
    - Worst Case (Most Common)
    - Average Case
    - Amortized
    - Best Case

- Factors To Ignore:
    - Small Input Size
    - Speed of the Machine

## Big O
### Formula
$$n \ge n_0, f(n) \le g(n)$$
