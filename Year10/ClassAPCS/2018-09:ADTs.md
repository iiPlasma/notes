# ADTs
- A description of a data structure containing:  
    - I. Some information about how the data is organized (maybe)  
    - II. A list of primitive operations that acess or modify the data  
    - **No Implementation Details**  
    
## ADT #01- List ADT
An ordered sequence of elements (not necessarily sorted)

### Primitive Operations
- `Length(list)` - Returns the number of elements in the list
- `GetFirst(list)` - Returns the first element in the list
- `GetLast(list)` - Returns the last element in the list
- `Prepend(list, x)` - Inserts x into list at the beginning
- `Append(list, x)` - Inserts x into list at the end
- `RemoveFirst(list)` - Removes the first element in the list
- `RemoveLast(list)` - Removes the last element in the list
- `CreateEmptyList()` - Reurns a newly created, empty list
- `IsEmpty(list)` - Returns `True` if list has no elements, else `False`

### Implementations
#### Array
##### Description
Continuous block of memory which is not dynamically allocated. Ex. Java.
##### Advantages
- Easy to work with and write
- Easy access to any element within the array

##### Disadvantages
- O(n) time to insert new elements
- Memory allocation issues
- Can't increase size without O(n)

#### Linked List
##### Description
- There are two types of objects - Node & Header:
    - List elements are stored in the nodes
    - Header is used to access the list

##### Advantages
- Improved running time over array
- Solves storage problems since it's dynamic

##### Disadvantages
- Harder to work with and implement
- Inserting elements is still O(n)
