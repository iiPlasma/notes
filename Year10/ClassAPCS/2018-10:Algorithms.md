## Merge Sort
### Merge Sort
- Split the array into two halves. Recursively sort each half.

- To merge 2 sorted arrays, create an empty array to hold the combined. Put a finger
at the beginning of both. Copy the lesser of the two keys into the next empty cell and advance one position.
Continue doing this till one array runs out. Move the rest of the array.
