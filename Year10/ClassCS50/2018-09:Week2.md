# Topic: Week 2
## Sort
### Selection Sort
- Description:
    - Find the smallest unsorted element, and add it to the end of the sorted list
    - Worst Case: $O(n^2)$
    - Best Case: $\Omega(n^2)$

### Bubble Sort
- Description:
    - Move higher valued elements to the right, lower to the left
    - Keep swapping adjacent elements until the counter = 0
    - Check to see if sorted if you don't need to swap
    - Worse Case: $O(n^2)$
    - Best Case: $\Omega(n)$

### Insertion Sort
- Description:
    - Go through the array and put elements in their correct place 
    - For each element find within the sorted section where it belongs
    - Worse Case: $O(n^2)$
    - Best Case: $\Omega(n)$

### Merge Sort
- Description: 
    - Recursively sorting the array, consider each element individual
    - Sort the left half then right half
    - Worst Case: $O(n \log n)$
    - Best Case: $\Omega(n)$
    
## Search
### Linear Search
- Description:
    - Look from left to right for a specified element
    - Still works if element isn't in the array
    - Doesn't have to be a sorted array
    - Worst Case: $O(n)$
    - Best Case: $\Omega(1)$

### Binary Search
- Description:
    - Array **HAS TO BE SORTED**
    - Divide and conquer, throw out half the array at a time
    - Worse Case: $O(n \log n)$
    - Best Case: $\Omega(1)$

## Recursion
- Description:
    - A function that calls itself during execution
    - Base case for when to stop
