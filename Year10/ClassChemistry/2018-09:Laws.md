# Topic: Laws
## Law: Law of Conservation of Mass
- Description: Mass is neither destroyed or created during chemical reactions or physical changes

## Law of Definite Proportions
- Description: A chemical compound contains the same elements in exactly the ration by mass regardless
of the size, sample, or source of the compound.

## Law of Multiple Proportions
- Description: If two or more different compounds are composed of the same two elements, then the ratio
of the second element combined with a certain mass of the first element is always the ration of small 
whole #s

- Ex.
    - Carbon & Oxygen: $CO$ or $CO_2$

## Protons
- The number of protons in an atom's nucleus determines the atom's identity
- (Atomic Number, Z):
    - Atomic Number: # of protons & indirectly electrons
    - Z: Atomic mass

- Nuclear Force: Short-range proton-proton, neutron-neutron, and proton-neutron forces that hold the 
nuclear particle together. Can be referred as "Strong force".

## Isotopes
- Description: Atom of the same element that differ in mass.
- They have the same number of protons but different number of neutrons

- Atomic Number: Number of protons
- # of protons determines identity
- # of neutrons determines mass $\to$ mass = protons + neutrons
- Revision to Dalton's Theory:
    - Although isotopes differ in mass they do not significantly differ in their chemical properties

## Mass 
- Description: Mass is the total amount of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the isotope
- Ex.
    - 2 protons + 2 neutrons = 4 $\to$ Mass Number of Helium - 4

## Misc.
- Nuclide: Particular kind of atom containing a definite number of protons and neutrons
- Mass #, A: Total # of nucleons(particles that make up the nucleus $\to$ protons and neutrons)
