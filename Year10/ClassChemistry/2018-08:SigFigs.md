# Topic: Signifigant Figures
## Rules
1. 1m = 10cm : Definitions (Infinitely Signifigant)
2. 3.94 : Nonzero Numbers (Signifigant)
3. 0.00034 : Leading Zeros (Never Signifigant)
4. 3.0094 : Captive Zeros (Signifigant)
5. Trailing Zeros:
    - 2.00 : Has Decimal (Signifigant)
    - 300 : No Decimal (Not Signifigant)

## Addition / Subtraction
$$ 2.004 + 6.9 = 8.9 $$
$$ 6.900 - 2.004 = 4.9 $$
The answer must have the same number of digits to the right
of the decimal as the number with the fewest digits to ther right
of the decimal point.

## Multiplication / Division
$$ 6.9 * 2.004 \approx 14$$
$$ 2.004 / 6.9 \approx 0.29$$
The answer must have no more sig. figs. than are in the measurement
with the fewest number

## Rounding (3 Sig. Figs.)
1. $6.789 \to 6.79$
    - If the last sig. fig. is followed by a >5, round up
2. $6.321 \to 6.2$
    - If the last sig. fig. is followed by a <5, round down
3. $6.55X \to 6.56$
    - If last sig. fig. is followed by a 5 with additional values, round up
4. $16.55 \to 16.6$
    - If last sig. fig. is odd and followed by only a 5, round up
5. $16.45 \to 16.4$
    - If last sig. fig. is even and followed by only a 5, round down
